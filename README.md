# Monte Carlo Simulation of Ion Transport in a Confined Channel  

This repository contains a Monte Carlo simulation for studying ion dynamics in a confined channel. The implementation includes the **Metropolis-Hastings algorithm** and **Umbrella Sampling** to analyze ion transport, energy barriers, and diffusion effects.  

## Features  
- **Electrostatic potential modeling**: Simulates the interaction between an ion and the channel.  
- **Monte Carlo sampling**: Uses the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to explore ion positions.  
- **Umbrella Sampling**: Introduced to overcome energy barriers and study rare transitions.  
- **Visualization**: Plots energy profiles and ion trajectories.  

## Installation  
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:  

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to simulate ion dynamics:

jupyter notebook MonteCarloProject.ipynb
